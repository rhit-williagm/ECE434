## TMP101
temp.sh outputs the temperatures, in Fahrenheit, of 2 TMP101 sensors. temp.py does the same, in python. interrupts.py prints the temperature if it exceeds the value of THIGH or goes below TLOW. Both limits are set in config_limits.sh

## Etch-a-sketch
grid.py implements the etch-a-sketch program on an 8x8 led matrix. User can control with WASD keyboard input. 


## Rotary Encoders

Configure eQEP 1 with config_e1.sh and eQEP 2 with config_e2.sh. grid_twist.py is the etch-a-sketch program controlled by 2 rotary encoders, displayed on the 8x8 led matrix.
