# hw01 - Etch-a-Sketch
This program simulates the classic "Etch-a-sketch" toy. Given keyboard input from the user, the program prints a 2D grid of "x"s, indicating the path that your "cursor" has traveled. This allows the user to create art.

## User commands
* w or W: move cursor up
* a or A: move cursor left
* s or S: move cursor down
* d or D: move cursor right
* c or C: clear the screen, while maintaining current cursor position (like the toy does)
